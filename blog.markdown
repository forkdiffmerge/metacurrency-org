Over on his webisteme blog, Eli has written some [very interesting thoughts](http://www.webisteme.com/blog/?p=926) about the MetaCurrency Projects' definition of currency.  The definition of currency we've been using is:

Currency: a formal system used to shape, enable or measure currents.

And Eli's proposing a more limited definition:

A currency is a commonly accepted formal system which shapes the flow of value.

I just contributed to the Human Project on Kickstarter, but I'd also like to open an inquiry here about the direction of our species that doesn't sound like it's included in their plans.It has to do with the rapid evolution we are undergoing which is creating a capacity shift for humanity that changes all the rules we currently take for granted in our industrial age economy and completes our shift into completely different information age dynamics.

The reason I blog is because there are not many people writing about the topic I'd most like to engage people in. Specifically, it is about **currencies as social DNA**.

You see, corporations, institutions, governments, and nations are **in fact** living organisms. This is not a lofty metaphor, but literal truth.

They have a survival instinct to self-perpetuate, they breed new corporations and institutions, and even as the cells within them are replaced, their fundamental pattern continues. And we are their cells.

#### Gift Transactions vs. Commercial Transactions

A lot of people seem to struggle with the concept of gift economies. Over the recent few hundred years, we have gotten so acculturated to market economies that we tend to project tit-for-tat exchange onto every interaction and into every motivation. However, I believe this is erroneous. My goal in this blog entry is to remind us of our deep familiarity with gift economies and to provide a clear contrast between them and market economies.

In [this post](http://alanrosenblith.blogspot.com/2010/09/core-of-metacurrency.html) over on his Symbionomics blog Alan Rosenblith nicely gets at the core of the MetaCurrency project by asking the question: "What would it take to make the role of 3rd party record keeping irrelevant?"

I love how projects can have many cores depending on the angle from which we approach them.  Here's the question that reveals my own very geeky approach toward a core of the MetaCurrency project: "What would it take to make currencies as powerful for building and sharing wealth, as language is for building and sharing meaning?"  

The answer to that question, I believe, lies in discovering/inventing a set of composable abstractions for wealth building.

To see what that might look like, lets examine how human language is built out of a multi-layered set of composable abstractions.

This is a reposting of a "meme-of-the-week" that I wrote as preparation for an open money conference in early 2008 on the now defunct open money Ning site.  I'm reposting it here because has a number of very important ideas that are foundational to the MetaCurrency project.

* * *

Since we are claiming that a fundamental open money meme is that money is information, then a number of things should follow from that. What follows are two representations of such a consequence. I've created both a visual table, as well as a narrative to go along with it, that describe another way of thinking about what open money is trying to achieve: wealth literacy.

Welcome to the MetaCurrency blog.  Those of us involved in the MetaCurrency project, have a [number of venues](http://www.metacurrency.org/links) where we talk about a range of currency related subjects, including personal blogs and other websites, but we felt it was time to start a blog to post on the progress of our technical work.

Here we'll post progress reports and new tech insights and questions as they come.  We're also going to collect up some of the writing we've posted in other places in the past as background material.  Enjoy!

In this <a href="http://lebleu.org/blog/2009/03/23/what-is-a-currency/" target="_self">blog post</a>, Guillaume Lebleu takes a stab at defining the word currency, and recommends keeping it fairly tightly bound to its traditional meaning around "a form of payment in a trade". So I thought it would be helpful to say some words about why in the meta-currency project we use the term currency in different and broader sense.

It has been requested that we try to describe the nuances of “open” and how the MetaCurrency Project compares with Cyclos in this department. I am not sure I am the best person to do this (Arthur and Eric are definitely more qualified), but here is my best attempt to describe the various types of openness we are talking about.

Open source is great. This means being able to openly access source code, change it, and share changes with a community of developers. Very awesome. And for Cyclos’ open sourceness I heartily applaud it.

Alan’s last couple of posts have attempted to address confusion Openness and what we mean when we talk about that with respect to currencies or the new economy. Responses from various folks indicate that more clarification would be useful.

For anyone not paying attention to the Internet (and since you are reading this blog, I consider that highly unlikely), the last fifteen years have seen a massive transformation in almost all nooks of society due to this marvelous invention. The Internet itself has been around for decades in various guises, but it wasn’t until the advent of the World-Wide-Web (from now on “WWW”) that the Internet gained mainstream acceptance.

I have been doing my best in recent weeks to drum up enthusiasm for creating an “open” economy. Here in Portland, I travel in both tech savvy and tech challenged circles. My experience has been that while the tech community really embraces “open” as a practice, the non-tech community seems a little bewildered. And what’s more, both communities seem to have confusion around applying the word “open” to anything currency-like. So here is my attempt at clearing the cobwebs.

Alan’s recent of posts (about P2P Currency and Currency Platforms) outline a trajectory that points in this direction, but I want to specifically spell out one thing that is so different about what we’re building than any other currency projects we’ve seen.

There are some fundamental shifts that must be made in currency infrastructure for us to break free of the constraints and dysfunctional patterns of the past, and I don’t believe that any prior platforms provide for these necessary shifts yet.

I was recently forwarded a question about the difference between LETS, time-banks, and Open Money. I struggled hard to find the right response and decided that the fundamental shift was from “currency designs” to “currency platforms.” What follows is my attempt to describe that shift.
